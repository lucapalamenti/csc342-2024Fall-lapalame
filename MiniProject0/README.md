## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

The ungrading practice allows me to focus less on 100% completeness of assignments, and more on the content that I can takeaway and learn from.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I've found that getting partial credit on CS assignments is very difficult. In 217 and 230 if my code didn't compile then it's an automatic 0, which is horribly demorralizing when I've just spent my entire day on an assignment and it's quite literally for nothing. With this grading technique I at least have the ability to plead my case.

## 3. On a scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
